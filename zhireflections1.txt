you should initialize
the repository because
i dont know the answer
hehe 
staging area is a place to put the current files in temporary mode
it give offer to control the flow to the working and repo 
directory
to confirm i use staging area

the reason for making branches is for the master will not be 
destroyed
actually i dont visualize it :)
